This leads to the problem for which we can solve. \n\nWe are trying to find a location in the city of Boston for a new resturant. We need to know the clusters of venues throughout the city and see which ones are the most poular. Then we can make an informed guess of the best place to create a venue in Boston MA.</p>"
